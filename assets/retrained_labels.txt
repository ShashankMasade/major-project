tomato early blight,Treatment: Make sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.Keep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.
potato late blight, Treatment : Water in the early morning hours, or use soaker hoses, to give plants time to dry out during the day — avoid overhead irrigation.Remove volunteers from the garden prior to planting and space plants far enough apart to allow for plenty of air circulation.
tomato bacterial spot, Treatment: seeds should be submerged for one minute in 1.3% sodium hypochlorite, which helps eliminate bacteria on their surface. Another option exists in submerging the seeds in 122-degree Fahrenheit water for 25 minutes. This will affect surface and inner seed bacteria, but might adversely affect the plant’s germination.
tomato leaf mold, Treatment:try to keep from wetting the leaves when you are watering the plants. When you water the plants, earlier watering is optimal because it allows the plant time to dry when the sun comes, keeping humidity around leaves to a minimum.
tomato yellow leaf curl virus--- Prevention: 1.use resistant or tolerant varieties. 2.use nets to cover seedbeds and prevent whiteflies to reach your plants.

grape leaf blight, Prevention : Remove infected plant material from the vineyard and destroy it.
cherry powdery mildew, Treatment :Plant resistant cultivars in sunny locations whenever possible.Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation. Make sure to disinfect your pruning tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.
squash powdery mildew, Treatment :Plant resistant cultivars in sunny locations whenever possible.Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation. Make sure to disinfect your pruning tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.
tomato mosaic virus, Prevention :The best factor in controlling and reducing infection is to practice sanitation. Remove any infected plants, including the roots. Remove Also, discard any plants near those affected.
apple scab, Treatment : Water in the evening or early morning hours (avoid overhead irrigation) to give the leaves time to dry out before infection can occur.Spread a 3- to 6-inch layer of compost under trees, keeping it away from the trunk, to cover soil and prevent splash dispersal of the fungal spores.
tomato target spot, Treatment :Warm wet conditions favour the disease such that fungicides are needed to give adequate control. The products to use are chlorothalonil, copper oxychloride or mancozeb. Treatment should start when the first spots are seen and continue at 10-14-day intervals until 3-4 weeks before last harvest. It is important to spray both sides of the leaves.
corn northern leaf blight, Treatment : Use resistant hybrids. Fungicides may be warranted on inbreds for seed production during the early stages of this disease. Crop rotation and tillage practices may be helpful in some cases.
